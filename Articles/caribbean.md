# Developing Countries Can’t Rely Solely on Agriculture

For many years, countries in the Caribbean relied heavily on agriculture to support themselves and generate income for the country. Unfortunately, there has been a recent major decline in agricultural activity, especially in crops like bananas, sugar, and vanilla. Caribbean nations have been able to overcome this deficit thanks to the money they bring in from tourism - the islands have the perfect combination of warm weather and beautiful landscapes to make them a leading travel destination. For many years now, the tourism industry has been the top generator of foreign exchange, bringing in billions of dollars which goes directly to the region’s economy.

## Tourism Supplies Jobs to the Local Communities

Increased tourism leads to increased employment. From resorts and hotels to restaurants, clubs, bars, diving schools and other adventure activities, Caribbean countries thrive on the jobs tourists create. Even people you wouldn’t normally think work in tourism do, right down to the fishermen and farmers who provide food for cafes, restaurants, and hotels. Jamaica alone hires thousands of people who work either directly or indirectly in the tourism industry, which is the second largest employer in the country. Increasing jobs also increases tax revenue, which can go into services and facilities for the local people.

## It Helps Raise Awareness

he problems and struggles of people living in the Caribbean are often hidden behind luxurious resorts. When people travel to the Caribbean islands, they typically don’t get to see the local side of the country unless they choose to do so through a volunteer opportunity. Issues that are important in this region of the world can be brought to light because of tourism. When people travel here, they hopefully become educated about their destination. When they return back home, they are then able to raise awareness about issues in the Caribbean

## It Helps Rebuild Communities After a Tragedy

The Caribbean has fallen victim to unfortunate tragedies over the years such as earthquakes and hurricanes. Tourism can help rebuild communities after such events by providing jobs and income for those affected.

## Conclusion

These are just some of the benefits of traveling to the Caribbean. Not only do travelers get to enjoy a beautiful vacation destination but they also contribute to supporting local communities and raising awareness about important issues.
